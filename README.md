# Chill & Charge Website

Welcome to **Chill & Charge** — the coolest combo of an ice cream stand (CHILL) and a mobile phone charging station (CHARGE) designed to serve South African hustle spots with sweet treats and power boosts! 🍦🔋

---

## Project Overview

This website offers two main zones:

- **CHILL:** Order delicious, custom-flavored ice cream with fun names and toppings 🍨  
- **CHARGE:** Info page about mobile charging stations placed in high foot-traffic areas ⚡

Orders are submitted online and stored locally for admins to view and manage. The site also captures customer location data for smoother delivery coordination.
